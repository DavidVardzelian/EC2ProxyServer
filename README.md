# EC2ProxyServer
This repository contains a simple proxy server implemented in C#. The proxy server listens for incoming HTTP requests, forwards them to the target server, and then sends the response back to the client. Itâ€™s designed to be lightweight and easy to deploy, making it suitable for basic proxy tasks.
